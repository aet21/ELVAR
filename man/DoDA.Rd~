\title{ELVAR algorithm detects communities from a node-attributed graph network}
\usage{
Eva_partitions(
  G,
  resolution = 1,
  threshold = 1e-07,
  alpha = 0.5,
  order = NULL,
  Vattr.name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{A node-attributed igraph object}

\item{resolution}{Tune the size of the communities. Default is 1. Community size decreases with the increment of resolution value}

\item{threshold}{If change in the quality function (score) is less than the threshold, iteration loop will be terminated}

\item{alpha}{Tuning parameter that makes balance between purity and modularity during optimization}

\item{order}{Defines numerical order among the characters present within an attribute}

\item{Vattr.name}{User-select node attributes that will be considered for Eva algorithm}
}
\value{
It is a list consists of
CommunityMembers:: is a vector where names are the nodes and the values are the communities belong to the nodes,
ModularityVal:: Modularity value, and
PurityVal:: Purity value
}
\description{
The code is a generalized Louvain clustering method that we call ELVAR (Extended Louvain Algorithm),
which is an R-implementation of the EVA algorithm. In ELVAR algorithm, node attributes information
along with graph topology enhance to find more relevant clusters specially when
clusters are not well-separated in high dimensional space.
