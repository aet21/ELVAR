# Summary

DICE is an R-package which uses the concept of Distance Covariance Entropy to help quantify bifurcation dynamics from scRNA-Seq data. Specifically, the package provides a suite of functions to quantify the degree of priming of a multipotent cell population in the context of a scRNA-Seq dataset encompassing multipotent cells as well as more mature cell populations representing competing downstream lineages. The package uses Distance Covariance Entropy (DICE) not only to quantify the degree of priming, but also to identify candidate regulatory factors implicated in priming as well as the corresponding primed cells. This methodology, which only requires scRNA-Seq data, has however been validated in datasets with matched scATAC-Seq data, either in the same cells (SHARE-Seq) or in separate cell populations representing the same cell-types.
