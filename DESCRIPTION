Package: ELVAR
Title: Extended Louvain Clustering Algorithm for Differential Abundance
        testing
Version: 0.1.5
Description: The ELVAR R-package implements a cell-attribute clustering algorithm called EVA to help identify cellular states associated with specific cell attributes (e.g. age). The package includes a downstream function to then perform robust differential abundance testing of cellular states (e.g. T-cell subtypes) across the cell attribute(s) used in the EVA-clustering step, using sample replicate information into account. The last step requires sample replicate information, and currently we only one cell attribute to be used when performing EVA.
